# Day 2

- learnt about the `Map` type
  ran into some issues with using an object as a key-value store while trying
  to implement `Two Sum` in TypeScript. ChatGPT suggested that I use a Map
  instead. did some light reading on it and was able to implement the solution.
- learnt how to make index signatures (indexable type declaration) so I could
  complete my initial implementation using an object as I'd initially planned.

did a few easy problems on LeetCode I'd previously solved using Python
