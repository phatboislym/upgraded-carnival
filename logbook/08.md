# Day 8

didn't do much today, but I did get a little more comfortable with the language

- went over my old TypeScript code and did some refactoring/bug fixes
- made some changes to the tsconfig file for the practice directory
- learned about the `in` keyword
- learned about the `instanceof` keyword
- learned about the `never` and `unknown` types

did the LeetCode Problem of the Day in TypeScript

- [938. Range Sum of BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-of-bst/)
