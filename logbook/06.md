# Day 6

I was busy today and didn't get much time to work on this.

I did a few more easy exercises on Exercism

- [Space Age](https://exercism.org/tracks/typescript/exercises/space-age)
- [D&D Character](https://exercism.org/tracks/typescript/exercises/dnd-character)
- [Darts](https://exercism.org/tracks/typescript/exercises/darts)
- [Pangram](https://exercism.org/tracks/typescript/exercises/pangram)
- [Bob](https://exercism.org/tracks/typescript/exercises/bob)

did a few more easy problems on LeetCode that I'd not previously solved before

- [383. Ransom Note](https://leetcode.com/problems/ransom-note/)
- [2460. Apply Operations to an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/apply-operations-to-an-array/)
