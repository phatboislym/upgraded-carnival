got lost in the [TypeScript Deep Dive](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29634529-typescript-deep-dive) book.

It was a bit of a mess in terms of structure but it has been interesting
reading all the same.

did an easy problem on LeetCode that I'd not previously solved before

- [2057. Smallest Index With Equal Value](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-index-with-equal-value/)

did a few easy Beginners's TypeScript tutorial problems on Totally TypeScript

- [Passing Type Arguments](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tutorials/beginners-typescript/beginner-s-typescript-section/passing-type-arguments)
- [Assigning Dynamic Keys to an Object](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tutorials/beginners-typescript/beginner-s-typescript-section/assigning-dynamic-keys-to-an-object)
