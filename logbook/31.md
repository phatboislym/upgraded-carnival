# Day 31

had some problems with unions of type literals, so I reviewed the first few chapters of `Learning TypeScript`.

played with example problems covering:

- type annotations and aliases for unions
- type annotations for literal types
- the difference between const variables with literal types and let variables with primitive types
- strict null checking and the `billion-dollar mistake`
- Excess Property Checking

solved a few problems on LeetCode
