# Day 39

had an annoying issue solving a LeetCode problem today, turns out that JavaScript's `Map` object uses the [SameValueZero](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/abstract-operations.html#sec-samevaluezero) algorithm for key comparison, which means it considers two different arrays as different keys, even if they have the same content.

did some problems on LeetCode today
