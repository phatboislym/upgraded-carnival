repo for `#100DaysOfCode`

I'll be trying to (re)learn TypeScript from scratch to go from “I can read this” to “I truly understand what is going on here.”

## Resources

this year I'm trying to change how I study by reading books more and using YouTube/online courses less

this will reflect in the choice of learning resources being heavily weighted towards books

### Books

    — Effective TypeScript by Dan Vanderkam (1st ed., O'Reilly, 2019)
    — Learning TypeScript by Josh Goldberg (1st ed., O'Reilly, 2022)
    — TypeScript in 50 Lessons by Stefan Baumgartner (Smashing Media AG, 2020)

### Online Courses/Tracks

— [Matt Pocock's Beginner's TypeScript tutorial on TotalTypescript](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tutorials/beginners-typescript)

— [Exercism's TypeScript Track](https://exercism.org/tracks/typescript)

### YouTube

— [Net Ninja's TypeScript Tutorial playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gUgr39Q_yD6v-bSyMwKPUI)
